            <p>Autism is big and messy and confusing, and no-one really understands it. It's difficult to make a good summary and description of autistic traits, because generally no-one can agree on what autism actually is. But even taking that into account, I've never read a satisfactory article or leaflet summarising and describing autistic traits. Every description I've ever read suffered from at least one of these problems:</p>
            
            <ul class="spaced-list">
	           <li><em>Wrongly weighted</em>. So many descriptions of autism written by neurotypical people focus completely on social traits. Often autism is described as an entirely social thing, and any other differences are considered incidental if they're mentioned at all.</li>
                
	           <li><em>Vague</em>. The "triad of impairments" is the worst offender here. It divides social traits arbitrarily into "interaction", "communication", and "imagination", but there is absolutely no clear distinction between those categories. They're meaningless and useless divisions that don't remotely simplify the description, and so they serve no useful purpose - they just add confusion.</li>
                
	           <li><em>Pathologising</em>. This is so extensive it's barely worth mentioning. Descriptions of autism almost universally describe it as a disorder, illness, or disease, and the traits as symptoms and deficits. This bias is both inaccurate and harmful.</li>
                
	           <li><em>Restrictive</em>. Autistic people are so incredibly varied. And yet often, the only acknowledgement of that diversity is a mention of "both ends of the spectrum", functioning labels, or a comparison of Asperger's and classic autism. Not only are these trivial attempts at expressing the variation between autistic people, they are actively harmful in their own right.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section id="solutions">
            <h4 class="section">Solutions</h4>
            
            <p>So, I've written my own. This isn't a set of diagnostic criteria, because I don't know how to diagnose autism. It's my best attempt at an <em>inclusive</em>, <em>accurate</em>, <em>useful</em>, and <em>value-neutral</em>, description of autistic traits and autistic people.</p>

            <p>A lot of the things I've written feature directly opposite examples, like "may hate X" and "may love X". This isn't a mistake, it's a reflection of how varied autistic people can be. Often, autistic people occupy extreme ends of the bell curve in any trait - but not necessarily the same end. Because I wrote this list to be inclusive, no autistic person will have every trait on it. That would be impossible, since many of them are mutually exclusive!</p>

            <p>The point is to include the widest possible range of  autistic traits, not the minimum range of criteria needed to define autism. Instead of showing what things every autistic person will have in common (which would result in the kind of pitifully small and generally useless descriptions found elsewhere), this list intends to show you the greatest diversity you can expect to encounter among autistic people.</p>

            <h4 class="section">The list</h4>

            <p>With all that covered, let me get to the actual list. It's divided into three broad categories of traits: social, sensory, and cognitive. These divisions are not perfect, but they're the best way I've found of categorising, and they make it easier to understand the list. Each category is divided into sections (numbers) and subsections (letters), which each contain a list of specific example traits.</p>
